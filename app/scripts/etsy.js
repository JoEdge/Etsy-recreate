Smaller custom made-to-order items are worked around larger orders and processing times may vary due to workload and season so please allow up to 2-3 weeks for your order to arrive.\r\n\r\nCUSTOM MADE TO ORDER ITEMS:\r\nAll orders are processed in a first come first serve basis.  Custom pieces are not put on the schedule until AFTER both payment and measurement information have been received.  Shortly after receipt of your measurement form, you will be notified of an approximate ship date when you can expect your order.  \r\n\r\nSIZING AND MEASUREMENTS:\r\nDesigns are typically based on standard American size proportions.  However, I request further information to ensure a proper fit.  Each item in my Etsy Store will state if a form is required or not.  The form on the link provided will need to be completed and emailed back in order for me to place your garment order on the schedule.  I will make the item according to the information provided.  I cannot be responsible for fitting issues caused by mistaken measurements - please measure carefully.  If you wish to forgo completing the form, any fitting issues are your responsibility.\r\n \r\nComplete the form fields and return as an email attachment to correenscdesigns@charter.net.  If you have any trouble getting the form to open, please let me know and I can email it to you directly.  A cut and paste into the body of an email works fine too.  Ask questions if you are unsure about any part of the measuring process.  Please use a cloth measuring tape and provide information in inches.\r\n\r\nTIMING:\r\nIf you have an event that your item is needed for please make me aware of it when ordering. I will do my very best to accommodate you. Should an event come up AFTER your order has been placed, again I will do my best to accommodate you, but no guarantees can be given. If you absolutely need the order to be bumped up on the schedule a rush fee and expedited shipping charges will apply.\r\n \r\nRUSH FEES: January-July\r\nIf an order is needed sooner than my next available spot on the schedule a rush fee will apply.  The following scale will apply for 2014.\r\n\r\nFor smaller items under $75, please inquire to check options and see if the item can be completed to accommodate your timing.  Items are priced according to complexity and of course more complex items take a lot more to get it done on time and therefore will be subject to the Rush fee.\r\n\r\nNEXT SCHEDULE SPOT AVAILABLE:         \r\n\r\nTier A - Orders $75 - 125 -  $75 Rush Fee\t\r\nTier A - Less than 2 weeks notice - $100 Rush Fee\r\n\t\r\nTier B- Orders $126-300 - $125 Rush Fee\t\t\r\nTier B - Less than 2 weeks notice -  $175 Rush Fee\r\n\r\nTier C - Orders $301 and up - $175 Rush Fee\r\nTier C - Less than 2 weeks notice -  $225 Rush Fee\r\n\r\nPlease understand that when an order is &quot;Rushed&quot; the extra cost covers the cost of the juggling, longer hours, extra hands and effort necessary to get your order out the door to accommodate your timing.  You will be responsible for expedited shipping charges necessary for both getting your fabric here and getting the finished piece to you.  I will send you your shipping options the day before shipment.  A separate invoice for shipping charges will need to be paid before the item will be shipped.  If you are interested utilizing this option, please request a custom listing or add the RUSH MY ORDER Listing to your cart with the appropriate fee from the selection menu. \r\n\r\n***DO NOT PURCHASE the listing without discussing first.  I need to confirm the possibility of accommodating you with my current schedule.\r\n\r\nHALLOWEEN:\r\nThe deadline for Halloween 2014 is September 1st.  All orders placed before that date will be ready to ship before October 27th.  Last orders in may be required to pay expedited shipping for their orders to arrive on time, you will be contacted prior to shipment with your options and an invoice will be sent accordingly.  I do my best to accommodate everyone&#39;s plans for this time of year but if an event comes up AFTER your order is in queue, you will need to purchase the RUSH MY ORDER listing.\r\n\r\nSHIPPING METHODS:\r\nI ship using either UPS or the United States Postal Service Priority or Express Mail.  Rates according to package size, weight and your address.  Tracking information will be forwarded to you upon shipping.  FedEx is available but due to bad experiences with their rates, a credit card number or FedEx account number will need to be provided.\r\n\r\nShipping will be sent to the address listed on your order unless further instruction is given  We cannot be held responsible for packages lost and misdirected due to insufficient address information. \r\n\r\nFor international customers, shipping rates posted are for USPS Global Priority Mail, if you prefer another carrier, please inquire and you will be charged via Paypal for the difference for shipping upgrades.  International customers are responsible for any package tracking, customs and duty processes once the item is shipped.  Each package will be marked with the value and merchandise box checked.  Please do not request me to check the gift box or fudge the value - it is illegal and I will not do it.\r\n",

I am confident in my sewing and creative abilities and strive to provide quality items at fair prices. If for any reason, you are not quite happy with any of my work, I will work with you to come to a resolution. Please call right away if an issue should arise. Issues need to be reported within 5 days of receipt per the records of the delivery service used. DO NOT WEAR or USE the garment until issue is resolved.  \r\n\r\nOnce an item is purchased it is custom made for the person who will be wearing it. Due to this custom service, returns are not considered. \r\n\r\nCare instructions will be provided for each item, my work is guaranteed, however, mis care for any item is not.

Email or call to discuss your ideas for a custom commission to correenscdesigns@charter.net. \r\nIf you have a photographs or sketches, please attach them to your email. I take pride in my own creativity and look forward to working with you to create the piece you were imagining.

For character costumes, I will do my best to create an amazing interpretation that will be sure to please.\r\n \r\nDuring the inquiry process, I will discuss your project briefly with you to determine a price estimate. If you decide to move forward, a reserved listing will be set up for you.  After you checkout, I will go to work on sketches of how your garment may look, coordinating your fabric and trim options, researching historical and other practical details necessary to bring the piece to life. \r\n\r\nDuring the whole custom process, I will be in contact with you and share progress pictures.  Should additional charges arise after the agreed price, an additional listing will be set up and must be settled prior to shipping.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION:\r\nThe best way to reach me to discuss details is via email. Sometimes it is easier to explain details over the phone, I do ask that you send an email after the conversation to reiterate key points so I can have the information handy for reference. I will do the same if I contact you with a question to confirm we understand each other. \r\n\r\nHOURS OF OPERATION:  \r\nCorreen&#39;s Creative Designs is open most week days from 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. and is located in Whitmore Lake, Michigan.

"description": "1980s Scooby-Doo FRONT Of Gum Machine Sticker Sheet UNUSED\r\n\r\nEstimated value: $10.00 each\r\n\r\nThese came from a Columbus gum machine company that has been out of business for several years.  This is one of those unused sticker sheets that slid into the front display of the gum machine / toy machine to show you the possible stickers you could get for $0.25 out of one of the many capsules inside.\r\n\r\nThis design was originally used in 1976 in gum machines and the stickers were 10 cents each.  The inner sheet was smaller back then.  This is from the 1980s and was series 2 of the designs and single stickers sold for 25 cents each.\r\n\r\nThis sheet can still be used and the stickers will still peel off.\r\n\r\nVery strange green tint on the faces even though these have never been used or displayed.  I have been told that they were green tint so that dealers who received the front panel of stickers did not cut them and try to sell them in the machine.  Novel idea and it also makes these pretty rare for the classic gum machine collector.  One of these sheets were made for every 1,000 regular stickers that were made to be placed in those plastic capsules.\r\n\r\nSheet measures roughly 5” x 7”.  \r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nNeed more than one sheet of these and want a great discount?  Message me and I can create a special listing for you and sell for the following prices (shipping is additional):\r\n\r\n1 sheet $5.00 each = $5.00\r\n2 sheets $4.00 each = $8.00\r\n4 sheets $3.50 each = $14.00\r\n8 sheets $3.00 each = $24.00\r\n\r\nJust let me know!!!",

Ask for insurance if you need it for peace of mind.\r\n\r\nCUSTOMS CHARGES Customs charges my occur as a result of your package arriving in your country.

We will provide the customs documents and will contact YOUR countries custom&#39;s office concerning the claim to allow payment by our insurance company. \r\n\r\nRUSH ORDERS: If you need something sooner then please contact us BEFORE you buy and ASK us if we can accomodate your request.
