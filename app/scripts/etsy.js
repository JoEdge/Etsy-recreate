"description": "A beautiful original 1927 Prohibition Prescription for Spirits Frumenti, the US pharmaceutical term for Whiskey...Zxvi (pint)...S. Zii Tid. (2 ounces 3 times daily)! This prescription was the fourth issue; it&#39;s the largest of all five and quite ornate. Please see photos!\r\n\r\nFrom the days of Al Capone, flappers and moonshine this was the only legal way to drink liquor in the US!\r\n\r\nThis prescription has poppies on the top corners, fleur-de-lys on the bottom, and spider-webbed borders!\r\n\r\nThe whiskey was prescribed for Harry Wilson, by Dr. Haughton Smith, on November 18, 1927 and was filled the same day by Pharmacist, Max Harry Siegel, of Siegel&#39;s Drug Store, in Trenton, NJ.\r\n\r\nIt was issued by the Treasury Department and is printed on fancy, beautiful paper, that was also used for U.S. currency. In the center is the old Treasury Seal with the Latin inscription, &quot;Thesaur. Amer. Septent. Sigil.&quot;. When you hold this prescription up to the light, PROHIBITION is watermarked, as with the metal strips that are used in U.S. bills today, the graphics are GREAT!\r\n\r\nThe prescription measures 6 1/2&quot; x 5 3/4&quot;, has light folds, otherwise, condition is excellent..a beautiful prescription...New Jersey poppy scripts are scarce!\r\n\r\nThis is a FANTASTIC piece of history and would be great to display in a pharmacy, doctor&#39;s office, museum, bar or office! I am happy to answer any questions, please feel free to email and thank you for your interest!\r\n\r\nPleased to combine shipping with other Prohibition Prescriptions, Liquor Licenses, Opium Forms & Pharmacy Labels. As always, many thanks to my regular customers for your continued patronage! :)",

"policy_welcome": "Welcome to Calico Juno Designs! \r\n\r\nWith a vast array of selections you can add our unique designs to any outfit for any occasion. Because  all of our pieces are handmade & made to order we can customize a design to your specifications and bring it to you with a promise of outstanding quality, service and value.  \r\nFeaturing over 1,700 designs all of our jewelry has no pre-made or fabricated parts. All gemstones and beads are wrapped individually by hand, and we even make our own hoops, french wires & clasps.  Precious and semi-precious gemstones, Austrian crystals, freshwater pearls, and other stones are used in combination to create a wonderful palette of colors to create original designs.\r\n\r\nAll designs can now be made in solid 14k gold.\r\nEmail us at CalicoJuno@gmail.com for price quotes or any questions you may have.\r\n\r\n**Custom Orders** - Any design can be modified to accomodate your bridal or prom look. Send us any pictures or material swatches to match stones. *NO RETURNS OR EXCHANGES ON CUSTOM ORDERS*\r\n\r\nAll bridal party orders of 5 or more of the same style will receive 15% off! \r\n\r\nJewelry is made to order, so please allow 2-3 days before shipping. \r\n\r\nJewelry is sent securely packaged via USPS first class mail. All US orders come with tracking. Shipping upgrades are available, please inquire.\r\n \r\nWhile we strive to make all the jewelry the same each time, and to look the same as what you see on our site, sometimes due to the nature of the stones and what we have in stock (shading of color, size, shape, faceting, inclusions, etc.), this isn&#39;t always possible.  Please understand that sometimes we may have to substitute a stone or use something slightly different.\r\n\r\nGemstones, Pearls, Stones, and Crystals: \r\n\r\nAll gemstones, pearls, and crystals used by Calico Juno Designs are carefully selected to assure that high-quality stones are used. \r\n \r\nCARE AND CLEANING OF YOUR JEWELRY\r\n\r\n(Turquoise, coral, and other porous stones are not recommended to be placed in cleaning solutions).\r\n\r\nGold - while gold-filled jewelry does not tarnish as does sterling silver, occasionally it can be cleaned/polished (the same way as regular 14k gold) using warm soapy water and an old toothbrush. Or, you can use a commercial liquid gold cleaner.\r\n\r\nSterling silver needs to be cleaned often to keep it bright and shiny, as it will tarnish and become dull and dingy looking, eventually oxidizing and turning almost black (unless you want it to look blackened). You can just dunk your jewelry in the liquid, swish it around for about 5-7 seconds and pull it out...any longer may damage stones!!! Keeping your sterling silver jewelry protected in a jewelry box or commercial jewelry bags infused with anti-tarnishing agents will help slow down the tarnishing. \r\nRinse with warm running water and dry with a paper towel (NOT a cloth or terry cloth towel, as it may snag!), and your jewelry will look bright and shiny again.\r\n\r\nAll Calico Juno Designs jewelry should be handled with care, as it is delicate. If it does snag on something, do not pull at the jewelry as it may stretch it out of shape. Gently hold the jewelry and try loosening the snagged item instead.\r\n\r\nWhile not being worn, the jewelry should be carefully stored in separate quarters away from other jewelry, to keep it from getting tangled. Optimally it should be hung up on special displays designed for hanging jewelry",
"policy_payment": "We currently accept PayPal and it&#39;s a secured way of payment. \r\n\r\n**We are now offering a 30 day layaway plan for all orders under $200.

"title": "Vintage 1929 Prohibition Whiskey Mrs Hyman Prescription Pharmacy Doctor Medical Liquor Bar Speakeasy San Francisco CA Bartender Mixologist",
"description": "A great original Prohibition Prescription for Whiskey ~ Zxvi (pint)...Zi q 3 hrs (1 ounce every 3 hours)! Please see photos!\r\n\r\nFrom the days of Al Capone, flappers and moonshine this was the only legal way to drink liquor in the US!\r\n\r\nThe whiskey was prescribed for Mrs. Hyman, by Dr. Jas. M. Best, on January 25, 1929, and was filled the same day by Pharmacist, Jules E. Brenner, of Brenner Brother&#39;s Pharmacy in San Francisco, CA.\r\n \r\nIt was issued by the Treasury Department and is printed on fancy, beautiful pink paper. In the center is the old Treasury Seal with the Latin inscription, &quot;Thesaur. Amer. Septent. Sigil.&quot;. When you hold this prescription up to the light PROHIBITION is watermarked, as with the metal strips that are used in U.S. bills today, the graphics are GREAT!\r\n\r\nThis was the pharmacist&#39;s duplicate copy, printed on the back are the &quot;Instructions&quot;, one of which is: &quot;This duplicate prescription must be retained by the druggist as permanent record, open to inspection by Federal Officers&quot;, the top copy was sent to the government.\r\n \r\nThe prescription measures 5 1/2&quot; x 4 1/2&quot;, has a few light bends along the top border, otherwise, condition is EXCELLENT...a great 1929 Prohibition whiskey script!\r\n\r\nThis is a FANTASTIC piece of history and would be great to display in a pharmacy, museum, bar or office! I am happy to answer any questions, please feel free to email and thank you for your interest!\r\n \r\n \r\nPleased to combine shipping with other Prohibition Prescriptions, Liquor Licenses, Opium Forms & Pharmacy Labels. As always, many thanks to my regular customers for your continued patronage! :)",

McCormick, on April 30, 1926, and was filled on May 4, 1926, by Fahey&#39;s Pharmacy in Ithaca, NY.\r\n\r\nIt was printed by the US Treasury Department on beautiful paper, that was also used for US currency. In the center is the old Treasury Seal with the Latin inscription, &quot;Thesaur. Amer. Septent. Sigil.&quot;. When you hold this prescription up to the light, PROHIBITION is watermarked, as with the metal strips that are used in U.S. bills today, the graphics are GREAT!\r\n\r\nThe prescription measures 6 1/2&quot; x 5 3/4&quot;, has a bend along the top, left border, a tiny spindle hole and one clipped corner (to void), otherwise, condition is excellent....a great script from New York&#39;s Prohibition!\r\n\r\nThis is a FANTASTIC piece of history and would be great to display in a pharmacy, museum, wine cellar, bar or office! I am happy to answer any questions you may have and thank you for your interest!\r\n \r\nAll items ship within 24 hours and I will contact you when I receive notification of any purchase, thank you! :)",

All the pieces you will find here have been created by me. \r\n\r\nI offer unique, contemporary, spiritual, and personalized jewellery designs. My drawings are of items involved with the sea as I have an incredible affinity for the ocean.  My paintings are modern, abstract, silhouettes of things you find in the world around you.  I have started personalizing the paintings also so they are perfect for baby showers, wedding showers and gifts, birthdays, graduations, and any occasion you want to customize.\r\n\r\nI take special care to ensure everything is of the outmost quality and that each piece is unique. I value every customer and try to make each transaction as pleasant as possible. \r\n Have an amazing day!\r\nSherri",
